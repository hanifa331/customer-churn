# Customer Churn Prediction - SyriaTel

## Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn for SyriaTel using supervised machine learning models. By analyzing customer behavior patterns, we identify churn-prone customers and provide actionable business insights.


## Problem Statement

SyriaTel faces significant revenue losses due to customer churn. The goal is to build a classification model that predicts the likelihood of a customer leaving, using features like service usage, support interactions, and plan types.

## Dataset

- Source: SyriaTel Customer Usage Records
- Features: Voicemail plan, International plan, Total minutes, Service calls, etc.
- Target: Churn (Yes/No)

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- SMOTE for handling class imbalance
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook

## Models Compared

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC AUC |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 78%      | 0.38      | 0.78   | 0.51     | 0.84    |
| Decision Tree       | 84%      | 0.65      | 0.63   | 0.64     | 0.79    |
| Random Forest       | 89%      | 0.79      | 0.70   | 0.74     | 0.83    |
| XGBoost             | **94%**  | **0.85**  | **0.70** | **0.77** | **0.84** |

## Final Model

**XGBoost Classifier**  
Best performance across F1-Score and ROC AUC. Tuned with class weighting and threshold optimization.

## Key Insights

- Customers without a voicemail or international plan are more likely to churn.
- High service call frequency correlates with dissatisfaction and churn risk.
- Longer call durations and higher charges may also be churn indicators.

## Recommendations

Targeted Retention Campaigns
Focus marketing and retention efforts on customers flagged by the model, especially those who frequently call customer service and lack a voicemail plan.

Service Quality Monitoring
Monitor high call volumes to customer support as early churn indicators. Enhancing support responsiveness could help retain such customers.

Product Bundling
Encourage customers to subscribe to voicemail or international plans, as they are associated with lower churn rates
