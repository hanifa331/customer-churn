## Customer Churn Prediction - SyriaTel
### Overview
 SyriaTel, a leading telecom provider, is experiencing a high customer churn rate—losing nearly 1 in 7 customers annually. This not only impacts revenue but also increases the cost of acquiring new users. To address this business challenge, we analyzed customer behavior data to predict churn and identify the key drivers behind it.

### Problem Statement.
SyriaTel is losing nearly 15% of its customers annually, impacting revenue and customer lifetime value. The company currently lacks a proactive system to identify customers at risk of churning.

This project uses customer usage and service data to build a predictive model, helping the marketing and retention teams intervene early with personalized actions to reduce churn and improve loyalty.
Project Objectives

SyriaTel is facing customer churn, which directly impacts revenue. The Customer Retention and Marketing Team wants to understand and predict which customers are most likely to churn.

##### Goal:
Build a classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn using features like service usage, international plan status, voicemail activity, and customer support interactions.

      Key Questions to Answer:

              > Can we predict churn based on customer behavior?

              > What are the most influential features in predicting churn?

              > How can SyriaTel use these insights to reduce churn?
Dataset
The dataset consists of customer usage records, with key features including:
- Voicemail plan
- International plan
- Customer service calls
- Total call minutes (day, evening, night, international)
- Number of voice mail messages
- Total charge
- Churn status (Yes/No)
Models Used
> Logistic Regression
> Decision Tree (Untuned & Tuned)
> Random Forest Classifier
> XGBoost Classifier
ROC Curve Comparison
The ROC curve visually compares model performance in distinguishing churners from non-churners. A higher area under the curve (AUC) indicates superior classification capability.
Feature Importance (XGBoost & Logistic Regression)
Key insights based on model feature importance analysis:
Top Influential Factors:
> Lack of a voicemail plan is strongly associated with churn.
> Frequent customer service calls indicate dissatisfaction and lead to higher attrition rates.
> International plan subscribers exhibit greater churn tendencies.
> High total day-time call minutes correlate with increased churn probability.
## Recommendations
Targeted Retention Campaigns
Focus marketing and retention efforts on customers flagged by the model, especially those who frequently call customer service and lack a voicemail plan.

Service Quality Monitoring
Monitor high call volumes to customer support as early churn indicators. Enhancing support responsiveness could help retain such customers.

Product Bundling
Encourage customers to subscribe to voicemail or international plans, as they are associated with lower churn rates..
Next Steps
   Feature Engineering Enhancements – Introduce behavioral tracking, call patterns, and tenure-based insights.
   Fine-Tune Hyperparameters – Apply Bayesian optimization for performance gains.
   Threshold Optimization – Adjust decision thresholds to balance precision and recall effectively.
   Deploy Model for Business Use – Develop an API for real-time predictions and monitoring.
## Conclusion
By identifying churn-driving factors, optimizing classification models, and implementing customer retention strategies, this project provides valuable insights for SyriaTel. Next steps focus on refining prediction accuracy, enhancing business interventions, and improving customer engagement.
