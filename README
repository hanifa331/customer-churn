## Project Overview

This project aims to help **SyriaTel** reduce customer churn by building a machine learning model based on customer behavior data. By identifying customers likely to leave, SyriaTel can take proactive steps to retain them — improving customer satisfaction and reducing revenue loss.



## Business Objectives

1. Predict customer churn using behavioral and usage patterns.
2. Identify the key features influencing churn.
3. Provide actionable insights to the Customer Retention and Marketing teams.



## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python 3
- **Libraries**:
  - Data analysis: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`
  - Imbalance handling: `imbalanced-learn`
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code


## Steps Taken

1. **Business Understanding**  
   Defined churn problem in the context of SyriaTel.

2. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   Inspected distributions, missing values, and feature types.

3. **Data Preparation**
   - Label encoding and scaling
   - Class imbalance handling with `SMOTE`
   - Feature selection using correlation and importance ranking

4. **Modeling**
   - Trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost
   - Optimized XGBoost threshold for better recall

5. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC AUC
   - ROC Curve plotted for all models

6. **Model Selection**
   - XGBoost (optimized threshold = 0.35) selected as best performer

7. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Delivered stakeholder-facing insights from feature importance



## Data Preparation Summary

- No missing values detected
- Target: `Churn` (binary classification)
- Categorical features encoded
- Numerical features scaled
- Class imbalance handled using **SMOTE**
- Features selected based on domain relevance and importance plots



## Stakeholders

- **Customer Retention Team** – Uses churn predictions to engage at-risk customers with offers and services.
- **Marketing Team** – Builds customer segments and targets them with personalized campaigns.
- **Data Science Team** – Maintains and improves the model over time.
- **Management** – Uses overall churn trends to guide strategic decisions.



## Best Performing Model

**Optimized XGBoost Classifier**  
- Accuracy: **92%**  
- Recall (Churn): **87%**  
- F1 Score (Churn): **0.76**  
- ROC AUC: **~0.84**

This model provides the best trade-off between capturing churners and minimizing false positives.



##  Key Insights

- Customers with **international plans**, **high service call frequency**, and **low voicemail usage** are more likely to churn.
- **Customer service experience** is a major churn driver.
- **Targeted interventions** should focus on these risk signals.
